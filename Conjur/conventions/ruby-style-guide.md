## Ruby Style Guide and Best Practices

This document serves as a style and best practices guide for Conjur contributors who are writing
Ruby source code. The purpose of this guide is to provide common conventions and to describe some
common pitfalls to avoid, so that our code base is consistent, readable, and maintainable across
various projects.

Much of the content for this style guide is drawn from publicly available Ruby style guides.

This guide is intended to be a "living document" in the sense that it's expected that it will evolve
as we refine and hone our Ruby knowledge base.
